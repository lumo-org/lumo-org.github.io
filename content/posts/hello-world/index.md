I love one GTK theme, but really dislike one color that it uses. In a previous github question with the author about a similar thing, he told the person that the colors are stored in a different file so they're easy to change. His exact message was:

Hi, I'm sorry for the very very late response, I'm glad you could adapt the theme to your needs, as an advice te easiest way to change color is by editing the variables within the gtk-3.0/_colors.scss file and then recompile the whole theme by running in your terminal sass gtk.scss gtk.css

Changing the color itself was easy, but I'm not entirely sure what sass is. I tried looking into it, but couldn't find much. I've never messed with customizing GTK themes, so I don't have much experience there. Could someone please elaborate on what sass is, or what alternative I should use?
